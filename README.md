# Spotify Monthly Playlists Manager

This is an application to automatically manage my monthly Spotify playlist. I've started to create a new playlist each month that includes all of the songs that I have discovered or have been really loving to listen to for that month. Then each month I start with a fresh playlist. The idea behind this app is to: 
1. Have a single playlist that people can follow, that always has the current months music (i.e. 'Alex's Monthly Playlists' would include the last month of music)
2. Each day, this app will automatically look at that playlist and save the newly added music to the corresponding month's playlist (i.e. '5.18' would be all music in May 2018)
